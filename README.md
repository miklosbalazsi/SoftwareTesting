A testing framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases. A framework is comprised of a combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently.These guidelines could include coding standards, test-data handling methods, object repositories, processes for storing test results, or information on how to access external resources.

Software Testing Framework Types : 
---
1. Linear Automation Framework
> Also referred to as a record-and-playback framework, testers donâ€™t need to write code to create functions and the steps are written in a sequential order.
3. Modular Based Testing Framework
> Require testers to divide the application under test into separate units.
5. Library Architecture Testing Framework
> Based on the modular framework, but has some additional benefits. Instead of dividing the application under test into the various scripts that need to be run, **similar tasks within the scripts are identified and later grouped by function**, so the application is ultimately broken down by common objectives. These functions are kept in a library which can be called upon by the test scripts whenever needed. 
7. Data-Driven Framework
> Separates the test data from script logic
8. Keyword-Driven Framework
> Each function of the application under test is laid out in a table with a series of instructions in consecutive order for each test that needs to be run. In a similar fashion to the data-driven framework, the test data and script logic are separated in a keyword-driven framework, but this approach takes it a step further.
9. Hybrid Testing Framework
> Combination of any of the previously mentioned frameworks set up to leverage the advantages of some and mitigate the weaknesses of others.
